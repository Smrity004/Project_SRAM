"Unlocking Efficiency: Introducing our 16-byte SRAM in 0.18Î¼m CMOS for Low-Power IoT Applications!

Before diving into the world of SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory), it's essential to understand why we need SRAM when DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) is already widely used in the world of computer memory. 
-> DRAM as a large but slower whiteboard.
-> It can store a lot of information, but it needs to refresh the content regularly, like rewriting things on the whiteboard so they don't fade away.
-> DRAM is like a bigger storage space that takes a bit more time to find and use information.

SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that's like a super-fast and easily accessible storage space for data that your computer or electronic devices need right now. 
It helps your devices work quickly and efficiently by storing and retrieving information rapidly. 
It's commonly used in things like your computer's CPU to make it faster, and it's also used in various other electronic gadgets to speed up their operations.
